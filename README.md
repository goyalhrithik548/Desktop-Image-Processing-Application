# Desktop-Image-Processing-Application

## Project Overview
This project allows users to convert images to grayscale and binary formats as well as apply a cartoon effect to images using OpenCV and Tkinter for the GUI. Users can load an image, perform conversions, and save the resulting images.

## Features
- Convert an image to grayscale.
- Convert an image to binary (black and white).
- Apply a cartoon effect to an image.
- Interactive GUI for selecting and saving images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- EasyGUI
- Tkinter

## Usage
Use the GUI to:
    - Load an image using the "Conversion of Image" button.
    - View the converted images (grayscale, binary, cartoon) in a Matplotlib window.
    - Save the cartoonized image using the "Save Cartoon Image" button.

## File Structure
- `IMAGE_CONVERT_TO.ipynb`: Main script to run the application.
- `pexels-free-jpg-206430-639024.jpg`: Sample image used for initial demonstration (replace with your own images as needed).

## Functions
### Data Extraction
- **Conversion to Grayscale:** Convert the image to grayscale and display/save it.
- **Conversion to Binary:** Convert the image to binary (black and white) and display/save it.
- **Cartoon Effect:** Apply a cartoon effect to the image and display/save it.
